# Machine-Learning-Trading
Capstone project in Udacity for Trading with Machine Learning

## The following jupyter notebook contains the main project
* MLtrading_report.ipynb

### Neural network hyperparameter optimizations
* MLtrading_neural_network_2hidden.ipynb (neural network with 2 hidden layers)
* MLtrading_neural_network_3hidden.ipynb (neural network with 3 hidden layers)

### Neural network robust testing with different number of splits of data
*  MLtrading_neural_network_1hidden_10splits.ipynb (neural network training with 10 splits) 
*  MLtrading_neural_network_1hidden_20splits.ipynb (neural network training with 20 splits)

### The following python files are necessary to run the project
* get_data.py: data retrival class
* Model.py: the model class skeleton
* NeuralNetwork_Cross_Entropy_mini_batch.py: the neural network class
* util.py: all the utility functions

### folders
* figures: contains the figures generated by the project
* data: contains the data - downloading some of the data files requires internet connection

### packages required to run the project
* python 3.5
* jupyter
* scikit-learn
* pandas
* numpy
* tensorflow
* matplotlib
